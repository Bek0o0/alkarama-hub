        </h1>

        <p className="text-textDark text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
          <strong>Alkarama Hub</strong> is a civic technology initiative built to support Sudanâ€™s recovery and nation-building efforts in the aftermath of conflict. The platform serves two main groups: Sudanese citizens on the ground who need a safe and reliable way to report local issues, and members of the Sudanese diaspora who want to contribute their skills and knowledge toward rebuilding their homeland.

            Our mission is to strengthen transparency, collaboration, and participation by offering a secure web-based environment where people can report corruption, security threats, health emergencies, and infrastructure needs. At the same time, we help bridge the gap between skilled diaspora professionals and verified initiatives on the ground in Sudan.
